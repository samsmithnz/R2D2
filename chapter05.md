# The dome

There were two options to create a dome, one was to pay hundreds of dollars to get a metal dome printed, the other was to spend hundreds of dollars on a 3d printer can create the dome ourselves. We went with the 3d printed option, and with help from this [onedrive link](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ADKfrqUz55r3P7E&id=E84CB8FD47152532%2143927&cid=E84CB8FD47152532), we were away and printing. The dome is so big, it needs to be printed in 8 pieces, 6 sections for the main dome, and 2 pieces for the top.
