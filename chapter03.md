## Cutting
To cut, we used a variety of tools. After some research, a jigsaw seemed the most appropriate, and I picked up one for less than $100 at Home Depot. I then used a drill to help make holes, and then cut around the shapes, then filing and sanding as needed. The first few pictures look rough - especially with the tattered paper over laying, but this looked better over time with sanding and slowly removing the template. Also remember - this is entirely internal and will not be visible in the final product

Learnings:
- The jigsaw blade got dull after a couple hours of cutting. Need to track this and change it every hour.
