## Cutting
To cut, we used a variety of tools. After some research, a jigsaw seemed the most appropriate, and I picked up one for less than $100 at Home Depot. I then used a drill to help make holes, and then cut around the shapes, then filing and sanding as needed. The first few pictures look rough - especially with the tattered paper over laying, but this looked better over time with sanding and slowly removing the template. Also remember - this is entirely internal and will not be visible in the final product

Learnings:
- The jigsaw blade got dull after a couple hours of cutting. Need to track this and change it every hour.

## Filing and Sanding

With the most of the pieces cut (see routing below), some rasps/files and sandpaper, we got to work putting together most of the pieces. I really was just sanding enough wood to get a good fit, before I was ready to glue. With that done, it's time to start the routing. For now, I'm leaving the glued paper on the wood, I may remove it, or just leave it. It's not hurting anything and helps me to remember how the pieces stick together.
