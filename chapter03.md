## Cutting
To cut, we used a variety of tools. After some research, a jigsaw seemed the most appropriate, and I picked up one for less than $100 at Home Depot. I then used a drill to help make holes, and then cut around the shapes, then filing and sanding as needed. The first few pictures look rough - especially with the tattered paper over laying, but this looked better over time with sanding and slowly removing the template. Also remember - this is entirely internal and will not be visible in the final product

Learnings:
- The jigsaw blade got dull after a couple hours of cutting. Need to track this and change it every hour.

## Filing and Sanding

With the most of the pieces cut (see routing below), some rasps/files and sandpaper, we got to work putting together most of the pieces. I really was just sanding enough wood to get a good fit, before I was ready to glue. With that done, it's time to start the routing. For now, I'm leaving the glued paper on the wood, I may remove it, or just leave it. It's not hurting anything and helps me to remember how the pieces stick together.

## Routing

This was my first time routing - I've never used a router before. It is pretty unforgiving. I experimented a bit with guides to make straight lines, but ultimately found it worked ok for long cuts, but for lots of little ones (as the round base and top have), it was easier to 'freestyle' - which after a bit of practice I was better at. 

First few attempts...

Starting to get the hang of this. This was my first cut on a template, and I was proud of the result

My daughter got involved, she likes to sand!
