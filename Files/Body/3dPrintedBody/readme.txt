MKIII Prusa Cut

These files have been sized to work with a Prusa i3 MK3S build plate - 250(x) x 210(y) x 210(z). They will also work on other printers of equal or larger size. All models have been tested with a .2mm layer height in PETG. All other parts should be taken from the MKIII print folder. The top ring can be taken from the Leon de Graaff cut.

The MKIII body is designed to be printed as individual single-piece rings, so when printing this version, be sure to use plenty of walls/perimeters on the parts, plenty of high-strength glue/epoxy, and hardware (usually M4 nuts and bolts) for maximum lateral strength. 

Important Tips: 

Large Parts: I recommend using a 4-5 mm brim on large parts to prevent warping.

Body: Built-in supports for the shoulders and utility arm models (Ring 4-1, 4-2, & 4-6) require a quick pass with a utility knife to prevent tear out on the surface when removing.

Skirt: Supports recommended but not required. The single piece MKIII skirt is printed without supports on the opposite side, but my prints came out better printed in this position with supports only at the top.

Body Greebles Alternate Cut: These are alternate cuts of the MKIII vents and useful if creating a non-painted droid.
