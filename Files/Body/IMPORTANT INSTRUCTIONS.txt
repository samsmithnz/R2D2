I've helped glue up quite a few wood frames.  This is the only way I'll ever glue up a wood frame.

Materials needed before you begin:
1.  Wood frame
2.  A set of skins with no panels removed
3.  Wood glue 
4.  Strong tape that does not stretch (the clear kind with fibers running through it works great)
5.  A perfectly flat surface to work on
6.  Paper to catch the oozing glue (like newspaper)
7.  At least one helper (each person should have a glue bottle)


Steps for a successful glue up:
1.  Lay some paper out on your work surface.
2.  Take your inner skins and tape one side together.
3.  Practice putting the frame together a couple of times until you can do it fast and easy.
4.  Put glue in the joints and assemble.
5.  Wrap the skins around the frame and tap the other side tightly.
6.  Reach into the frame and push the ribs outward till they touch the frame.
7.  Push the top plate of the frame down.
8.  Leave the skins around the frame for at least an hour.
