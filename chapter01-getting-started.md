## Chapter 1: Getting started 

It all started with a nerd conference. My 10yo son Finn and I were approached by a full sized, remote controlled R2D2. We asked the owner "did you make this?" He did, and gave us a business card and a sticker... The business card had a link to [astromech.net](https://astromech.net/), a forum where people build their own droids. It made me wonder if this would be a good project for my son and I... what do we have to lose? Let's start and see where we end up...
