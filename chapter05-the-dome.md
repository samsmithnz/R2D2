# The dome

There were two options to create a dome, one was to pay hundreds of dollars to get a metal dome printed, the other was to spend hundreds of dollars on a 3d printer can create the dome ourselves. We went with the 3d printed option, and had no issues finding already designed 3d printed files. The dome is so big, it needs to be printed in 8 pieces, 6 sections for the main dome, and 2 pieces for the top. With my new Prusa Mk4 printer, I printed all the pieces in PETG white. 

Next I printed all of the panels, and after a few hours research and hanging out at my local hardware store, zeroed into a color that seems to be very close: 

> **Benjamin Moore: Interior Matte**<br>
> S1 0x 1.1250<br>
> W1 0x 10.1875<br>
> M1 1x 8.0625<br>
> B1 1x 12.6250<br>

Each piece required about 3 coats. I experimented with a primer and not a primer, and it didn't seem to matter, I needed 3 coats of paint, and it's easier to just be one (blue) color.
