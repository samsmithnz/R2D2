## Creating the legs

Moving to the legs was an interesting transition. While the creation of the frame was very well documented, if there were 20 videos of creating the frame, there was only 1 for creating the legs - and even these tended to assume you'd already cut out the pieces.

Piecing together a few pieces, [the plan](https://github.com/samsmithnz/R2D2/blob/main/Files/Legs/Leg%20-%20Leg%20%26%20Ankle.pdf), and then [some instructions](https://github.com/samsmithnz/R2D2/blob/main/Files/Legs/WoodenLegTutorial.pdf), I worked out I needed to create a template from the plan and apply it to 4 pieces of wood:

This is for each of the two legs
1. We need two 1/2" cut outs (total of 4 for both legs)
2. We need one 3/4" cut out (total of 2 for both legs). We will cut out the middle to leave a 1" perimeter - this is to allow for electronics and things to be routed to the feet later
