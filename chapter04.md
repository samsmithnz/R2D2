## Creating the legs

Moving to the legs was an interesting transition. While the creation of the frame was very well documented, if there were 20 videos of creating the frame, there was only 1 for creating the legs - and even these tended to assume you'd already cut out the pieces.

Piecing together a few pieces, [the plan](https://github.com/samsmithnz/R2D2/blob/main/Files/Legs/Leg%20-%20Leg%20%26%20Ankle.pdf), and then [some instructions](https://github.com/samsmithnz/R2D2/blob/main/Files/Legs/WoodenLegTutorial.pdf), I worked out I needed to create a template from the plan and apply it to 4 pieces of wood:

This is for each of the two legs
1. We need an outside 1/2" cut out (total of 2 for both legs)
2. We need an inside 1/2" cut out (total of 2 for both legs)
3. We need a 3/4" cut out (total of 2 for both legs). We will cut out the middle to leave a 1" perimeter - this is to allow for electronics and things to be routed to the feet later
4. We need two 3/8" cut outs for the ankles

This sketch shows the different layers I'm planning to cut

There are additional layers that go on top (horse shoe shoulder, and some details), but this is the main pieces to get to the legs done. 

I cut out one of the templates, and traced it, four times on the 1/2" plywood, and twice on the 3/4" plywood.

Starting the cutting with the jigsaw!

On the 3/4" templates, we also cut out the center, about 1" from the edges - this is the center piece that any wires/mechanics/electronics will sit in.

Then we put the pieces together. 1/2" on each side, with the 3/4" piece in the middle

### The shoulders
- 12x 5/16" wide by 2" long, with a 1/2" hexagonal bolt head (labeled "AKD" at Home Depot). Only one half of the screw is threaded, the half furthest from the hexagonal bolt head
- 8x 1/4" wide by 2" long with a 3/8" hexagonal bolt head (labeled "BL"), and are also only threaded on the half furthest from the hexagonal bolt head
- 12x t-nuts I used have a 3/8" outer diameter, and a 5/16" inner diameter
- 1" gas pipe (2 ft long?)
- 3/4" gas pipe
